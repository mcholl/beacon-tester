Beacon Tester:


	Define basic Scenarios to be run:
		-	All Front Pages have the basic beacons: Omniture, Chartbeat, Double_Click, Comscrore
			This scenario just hits the home page of each site an verifies the basic analytic tags all fire
				- Implement a Values Table:
					- Setup a table for 5 papers with default beacons
					-	See taht Cucumber executes it 5 times

		-	Subscription pages should have the following beacons: Marin
			This scenario (which was the actual original requirement) verifies that a user can subscribe to the paper, and that the Marin Tag fires at the end of it with the correct parameters

		-	Marketing tags on each section front for selected papers: TBD
			Here we need a matrix of marketing tag and the pages on which we expect them.  It will grow over time

	Be able to collected network traffic:
		- with a timeout @done(2014-09-10)
		-	optionally with screenshots @done(2014-09-10)
		-	and be able to save a HAR file
		-	See what happens with a tag that does a POST. Per Rob, most of them are Gets, but we probably need POSTs too.

	Be able to support the following paramater tests:
		Beacon Calls:
		- There will be a beacon call to a url of xxx	[required] @done(2014-09-10)
		-	There will NOT be a call to a url of xxx	[excluded] @done(2014-09-10)
		-	There will be n beacon calls to a url of xxx	[required n or more calls] @done(2014-09-10)
		-	There could be a beacon call to a url of xxx [optional] @done(2014-09-10)

		Parameters:
		-	Parameter matches value @done(2014-09-10)
		-	Parameter contains value @done(2014-09-10)
		-	Parameter matches regular expression @done(2014-09-10)
		-	Parameter has a value of {string, numeric, date} @done(2014-09-10)
		-	Be able to specify "a XXX parameter" or "an XXX parameter"

		-	If the beacon call defining an optional service does not exist, skip the parameter tests

		-	Omniture specific parameters:
			- RSID
			-	variable expansion

	Be able to monitor the tags consistently:
	-	Set up a Jenkins job to execute tests and notify XXX of any failures

	Document it:
